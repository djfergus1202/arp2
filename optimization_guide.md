# Free Tier Optimization Guide for Academic Research Platform

## Memory and Performance Optimizations

### 1. Efficient Data Processing
- **Batch processing**: Process data in smaller chunks to avoid memory spikes
- **Smart sampling**: Use statistical sampling for large datasets (already implemented)
- **Lazy loading**: Load data only when needed for specific analyses

### 2. Resource Management
- **Session state cleanup**: Clear unused data from Streamlit session state
- **Memory-efficient visualizations**: Use Plotly's efficient rendering
- **Optimized molecular analysis**: Use py3dmol's lightweight 3D rendering

### 3. Network and API Optimizations
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in delays for API calls (CrossRef, PubMed, UniProt)
- **Caching**: Cache API responses to reduce external calls
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Use local calculations when APIs are unavailable

## Code Optimizations for Free Tier

### MATLAB-style Analysis (Memory Efficient)
```python
# Efficient numerical computing
def optimize_for_free_tier():
    # Use vectorized operations
    results = np.vectorize(calculation_function)(input_array)
    
    # Process in batches
    batch_size = 100
    for i in range(0, len(data), batch_size):
        batch = data[i:i+batch_size]
        process_batch(batch)
    
    # Clear memory after processing
    del large_variables
    gc.collect()
```

### Interactive Parameter Control (Lightweight)
- Dynamic parameter adjustment without full page reloads
- Efficient state management using Streamlit session state
- Smart data generation with parameter caching

### Molecular Visualization (Optimized)
- py3dmol uses WebGL for efficient 3D rendering
- Selective protein structure loading
- Optimized molecular property calculations

## Best Practices for Free Tier Usage

### 1. Modular Usage
- Run individual analysis modules separately
- Use the multi-page architecture to manage memory
- Process data incrementally rather than all at once

### 2. Smart Data Management
- Upload smaller PDF files for analysis
- Use statistical sampling for large datasets
- Process molecular structures selectively

### 3. Efficient Workflows
- Save intermediate results to avoid recalculation
- Use the validation system incrementally
- Leverage the mathematical engine's caching

## Resource Monitoring

### Memory Usage Tips
- Monitor Streamlit's memory indicator
- Clear browser cache if visualization becomes slow
- Restart the application if memory usage is high

### Performance Indicators
- Network visualization: Limit to 100-500 compounds
- 3D molecular maps: Process 20-50 drugs simultaneously
- Statistical analysis: Batch process large datasets

## Free Tier Limitations Workarounds

### Public Visibility
- Your research platform will be publicly visible
- Consider this for educational/demonstration purposes
- No sensitive data should be processed

### Resource Limits
- CPU: Efficient algorithms minimize processing time
- RAM: Smart memory management prevents crashes
- Storage: Use temporary files, clean up after processing
- Network: Built-in rate limiting respects API quotas

## Deployment on Free Tier

### Streamlit Configuration
```toml
# .streamlit/config.toml
[server]
headless = true
address = "0.0.0.0" 
port = 5000
maxUploadSize = 50

[theme]
base = "light"
primaryColor = "#1f77b4"
```

### Python Dependencies
All required packages are lightweight and work well on free tier:
- Core: streamlit, pandas, numpy, scipy
- Visualization: plotly, matplotlib, seaborn  
- Scientific: biopython, rdkit, py3dmol
- NLP: nltk, spacy (optional)
- Mathematical: sympy (no external dependencies)

## Troubleshooting Free Tier Issues

### Memory Errors
1. Reduce dataset size using sampling
2. Clear browser cache and refresh
3. Restart the Streamlit application
4. Process data in smaller batches

### Slow Performance
1. Limit network visualizations to top compounds
2. Use efficient data structures (numpy arrays vs lists)
3. Enable browser caching for static assets
4. Process molecular structures selectively

### API Rate Limits
1. Built-in delays between API calls
2. Fallback to cached/local data
3. Use batch processing for multiple queries
4. Implement exponential backoff for failures
